# Project Progress: Contact Form Structure Implementation

## First Stage—Overview of the Implementation

The contact form is designed to enable users to communicate effectively with the application. To achieve this, we have 
developed key structures that ensure functionality, validation, and an intuitive user experience. These structures not 
only maintain a smooth flow of data but also facilitate real-time error handling.

The primary goal has been to implement a practical and user-friendly feature while ensuring the code remains maintainable
and adaptable for future improvements.

## 2. Implemented Features

### 1. **Form Structure**

The form is built as a functional React component, ensuring modularity and flexibility. This design keeps the codebase 
clean and easy to maintain. The main elements of the form include:
- Input fields for name, email, and message.
- A submit button that triggers validation before processing the data.
- Dynamic error messages that appear under fields when inputs are invalid.

### 2. **State Management**

Two primary state hooks, `useState`, are used to manage the form’s dynamic behavior:
- **`formData`**: Stores the user input.
- **`errors`**: Tracks the validity of each field in real time.

Both states are automatically updated as users interact with the form.

### 3. **Validation System**

Validation is performed using utility functions defined in an external file (`validation.js`). These functions ensure that 
input meets specific criteria:
- **Name Validation**: Checks for invalid characters.
- **Email Validation**: Verifies the format of the email address.
- **Message Validation**: Ensures the field is not empty.

### 4. **Error Handling**

Each field has its own error state, which is dynamically updated based on validation. This ensures that error messages 
are specific and user-friendly. For instance:
- If the name is invalid, an *"Invalid Name"* message appears under the corresponding field.
- Errors automatically disappear once the user corrects the input.

### 5. **Event Handling and Dynamic Functionality**

To provide a seamless experience, several event handlers have been implemented:
- **`handleFormData`**: Updates the user input and validates the corresponding field.
- **`handleChange`**: Combines data updates and validation to keep the form synchronized in real time.
- **`handleSubmit`**: Ensures all fields are valid before processing the form. If any field is invalid, a general alert 
- notifies the user that the form is invalid.

## C. Code Example

A snippet from the form demonstrates how dynamic error handling works:

```jsx
<label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
<input
    type="text"
    id="name"
    name="name"
    value={formData.name}
    onChange={handleChange}
    required
    placeholder="Enter your name"
/>
{errors.name && <span className="error">Invalid Name</span>}
```
